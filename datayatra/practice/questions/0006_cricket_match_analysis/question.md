## üìù Question

Write an SQL query to **find the names of players** who:

- Belong to the team `'Super Strikers'` **or** `'Power Hitters'`
- Scored **more than 30 runs**
- **Did not get out** in the match
- The match was **not played in the month of May**
- Order the result by `runs_scored` in **descending** order and then by `player_name` in **ascending** order

### ‚úÖ Expected Output Columns

- `player_name`
- `team_name`
- `runs_scored`
- `match_date`

---

## üí° Hints

- Use `WHERE` to filter the team and conditions.
- Use `OR`, `AND`, and `NOT` carefully to combine conditions.
- Use the `MONTH()` function to extract the month from `match_date`.
- Use `ORDER BY` with multiple columns.

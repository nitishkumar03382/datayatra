# ⚡ List Comprehension in Python

List comprehension is a concise and elegant way to create new lists in Python. It allows you to write shorter and more readable code when working with lists.

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax

>```python
>[expression for item in iterable]
>```

> Example

>```python 
>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>
>squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
>print(squares)
>```

**Output**

>```
>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>```

## 🧪 With Condition (Filtering)
You can add a condition to include only specific items.

> Example

>```python
>numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>
>even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
>
>print(even_numbers)
>```

**Output**

>```
>[2, 4]
>```

## 🔁 Nested Loops in List Comprehension

You can include nested `for` loops as well.

> Example

>```python
>pairs = [(x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4]]
>
>print(pairs)
>```

**Output**

>```
>[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
>```

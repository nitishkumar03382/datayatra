# 🎁 Pack and Unpack Tuples in Python

In Python, **packing** and **unpacking** tuples are useful features that allow you to group and retrieve multiple values easily. These concepts make your code clean, readable, and efficient.

## 📦 Packing a Tuple

**Packing** means assigning multiple values to a single tuple variable.

> Example

>```python
>info = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
>print(info)
>```

**Output**

>```
>('Alice', 25, 'Engineer')
>```

## 📤 Unpacking a Tuple

**Unpacking** is the process of extracting values from a tuple and assigning them to individual variables.

> Example

>```python
>info = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
>
>name, age, profession = info
>print(name)      
>print(age)        
>print(profession) 
>```

**Output**

>```
>Alice
>
>25
>
>Engineer
>```

## 🌟 Using Asterisk `*` for Flexible Unpacking

The `*` operator can be used to capture remaining values as a list.

> Example

>```python
>numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>
>first, *middle, last = numbers
>
>print(first)   # Output: 1
>print(middle)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
>print(last)    # Output: 5
>```

**Output**

>```
> 1
>
> [2, 3, 4]
>
> 5
>```

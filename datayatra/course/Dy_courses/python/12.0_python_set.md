# 🧃 Sets in Python

A **set** is a built-in Python data type that represents an unordered collection of **unique** items. Sets are commonly used when you want to store multiple items but ensure that there are **no duplicates**.

---

## 🔑 Key Characteristics of Sets

- Unordered (no indexing)
- Do not allow duplicate values
- Mutable (can be changed)
- Can contain different data types

---

## 🛠️ Creating a Set

> Example:

>```python
>my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
>print(my_set)
>```

**Output**

>```
>{1, 2, 3, 4}
>```

 ## 🚫 Duplicate Not Allowed

Sets in Python do **not** allow duplicate values. If you try to add the same element more than once, it will appear only **once** in the set.

> Example

>```python
>my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
>print(my_set)  
>```

**Output**

>```
>{1, 2, 3}
>```

## 📏 Length of a Set

To find how many items are in a set, use the built-in `len()` function.

>  Example

>```python
>my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
>print(len(my_set))  # Output: 3
>```

**Output**

>```
>   3
>```

## 🧪  Set - Data Types 

A set in Python can hold elements of **different data types**, including integers, strings, floats, and even tuples (as long as they are immutable).

> Example

>```python
>my_set = {1, "hello", 3.14, (2, 4)}
>
>print(type(my_set))
>```

**Output**
>```
>   <class 'set'>
>```
